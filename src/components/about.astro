  <div class="space-y-1 text-gray-700">
    <p>
      My name is <span class="font-semibold">Doni Indira Putra</span>. I was
      born in Jakarta, but I grew up in Long Iram sub-district, Kutai Barat
      district, East Kalimantan province, Indonesia ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm the kind of <span class="font-semibold"
        >person who loves to learn new things</span
      >, especially through <span class="font-semibold"
        >hands-on experience</span
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      My coding journey began quite differently than most. Rather than starting
      with web basics, I first learned programming using <span
        class="font-semibold">C and C++</span
      > for university projects, along with <span class="font-semibold"
        >QT Designer</span
      > to build desktop applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I ventured into web development, I started with <span
        class="font-semibold">CodeIgniter</span
      > as my first framework. During my internship, I gained experience with CMS
      platforms like <span class="font-semibold">OctoberCMS</span>. Eventually,
      I discovered <span class="font-semibold">Laravel</span>, which has become
      one of my primary tools to this day.
    </p>

    <p>
      For mobile development, I initially explored <span class="font-semibold"
        >Flutter</span
      >, but later switched to <span class="font-semibold">React Native</span> because
      of its cross-platform capabilities and familiar syntax for web developers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, <span class="font-semibold">Laravel</span> and <span
        class="font-semibold">React Native</span
      > are my main focus areas, though I remain open to exploring new technologies
      and frameworks. I occasionally work with <span class="font-semibold"
        >React.js</span
      >, particularly <span class="font-semibold">Next.js</span>, for web
      projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy keeping up with the constantly evolving <span
        class="font-semibold"></span
      >â€”its tools, libraries, frameworks, and even the community discussions
      (and occasional drama) that make it such an interesting space.
